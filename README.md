Here you can see the tools used to build the AerialShots website

[AerialShots](https://aerialshots.se)

## Tools

The website is created using only HTML and CSS. Considering the simplicity of the website
i did not feel usage of a framwork nessecary in this case.

I used firebase to host the site but the files for that are not included in this repo
mainly because of security reasons.

[Firebase Console] (https://console.firebase.google.com)
