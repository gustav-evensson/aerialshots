## About the project

![](https://github.com/gustav-evensson/aerialshots/blob/main/website/assets/4xlogo.png)

[AerialShots](https://aerialshots.se) is a static SPA that I build as a landingpage for my side business where i shoot drone footage. I figured I would add it to my portfolio aswell even if it's not the most exiting project to show. 

## Tools used

### The website

The website itself is built using HTML & CSS due to the simplicity of the site I did not find it neseccary to use a framework.

### The design

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) has always been my go to tool when it comes to anything regarding design or graphics. So for this figma did the trick.

### Hosting

I seem to always keep [firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com) in mind when it comes to backend and hosting. I got my domain quick and easy from [name.com](https://www.name.com/) wich i think is a good tool for dealing with domains. They also helped me setup my contact@aerialshots.se E-mail.
